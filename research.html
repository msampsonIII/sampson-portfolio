                    <div class="project-blurb">Jammed Granular Matter is the study of the manipulation of loose
                        aggregate materials into load bearing architectural structures. Because of its availability and
                        size, sand is an excellent granular material for scaled, reversible structures in construction.
                        Sand forms to a mold when wet, but cannot hold its form or support a load without a mold. By
                        incorporating the concept of mechanically stabilized earth--the placement of fibrous
                        reinforcement in horizontal layers to strengthen soil during construction – the wet sand is
                        structurally reinforced. The result is a load bearing structure, using sand as a compressive
                        granular material, and natural fibers as the tensile reinforcement.
                        Jammed granular structures involves less preparation, is instantly solid, and completely
                        reversible. “Sand Printing” has a noticeable increase in efficiency. Concrete has a very low
                        tensile strength but is strong in compression, which behaves similar to granular matter that is
                        reinforced with fibers. Without horizontal layers of reinforcement combined with wet aggregate,
                        the shear stress caused by the weight of the sand would be sufficient to cause a sliding failure
                        of the structure.</div>

                        MODULAR FABRICATION</div>
                    <div class="project-blurb">This project employs minimum inventory, maximum diversity design
                        strategies and additive &
                        subtractive fabrication techniques to develop a proposal for a modular building kit. The
                        building
                        kit is to be used by 8 to 16-year-olds and can be assembled in multiple ways to simulate
                        different environments with an emphasis on providing options for creative building experience,
                        rapid installation, disassembling, and repackaging. The hive toy set is designed to expand on a
                        equilateral hexagonal grid in all directions for kids to design and create their own buildings.
                        The building kit incorporates basic building elements, walls, windows, columns floors, and
                        roofs,
                        to engage in the user to create expansive enviroments. This prototype tested assembly for the
                        building kit using an interlocking system for parts and pieces to slide in. Pieces within in the
                        send
                        slide and snap into place. With base grid pieces, one can use coluumns for the expansion and
                        formation of the grid. Wall pieces inbetweeen the columns and the roof pieces snap in place
                        above on columns and above the walls. Through the manipulation and arrangement of the
                        pattern, children, and adults a like can configure various designs of their own hive.</div>
