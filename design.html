                        sited at the current
                        Peachtree Marta Station in Downtown Atlanta, Georgia. The design is a formal representation
                        of todays current climate. Taking an optimistic approach, the design seeks to represent the
                        trial
                        and tribulations of todays technological advancement and the current the political and social
                        landscape through the constant twist the occurs through the gallery spaces.
                        The vertical aesthetic seeks to represent todays aspirations for peace and progress despite
                        todays conflict. The sculptural design is achieved through computational design methods and
                        CAD software. Initial schematic designs were developed through Grasshopper and then refined
                        in RhinoScript. The parti models were then transferred to Revit for full on BIM construction.
                        Stacking diagrams determined to the functional relationships of spaces and careful site analysis
                        determined the proper twist for the building. The overall design is accomplished one-way
                        slab and slanted columns with a reinforced concrete core. The Peachtree Cultural Center is a
                        modern twist on this prominent block.</div>

                        Center in Pensacola,
                        Florida’s Belmont DeVillier’s neighborhood. This center will cater to the social, educational,
                        and
                        physical needs of those in the neighborhood. The program for the building will include a gym,
                        multiple meetings rooms, a multipurpose dining area, and multiple gardening areas. These
                        facilities
                        will serve as the new core for the Belmont DeVillier’s Neighborhood. The project will look

                        with the neighborhood.
                        When designing the Community Center of the Belmont DeVilliers neighborhood, which will
                        serve as the unifying center of the community, one mustvv be designing with the expansion
                        of the neighborhood in mind. The generic city theory praises concepts such as
                        flexibility—adaptation
                        to the present needs unswerving to those desires of the past or future. Consequently,
                        the community center will be designed to be multi-functional and adaptive to serve the many
                        facets of the community members and their needs. Through this Community Center, the neighborhood
                        looks to expand towards the future, to create a dense urban portion of Pensacola, FL.</div>

                        as a vibrant and
                        vanguard model of healthy, biophilic living for the future of the city. The project considers a
                        site in Queens, just south of the Queensborough/ Ed Koch Bridge. Overlooking the east river,
                        with views to Roosevelt Island and Manhattan, the vacantsite can be understood as a segment
                        within a larger chain of mixed-use waterfront development in the Borough, including
                        the Hunters Point and Annabel Basin projects underway to the south, and stretching south to
                        Brooklyn and north to the Bronx.
                        These new approaches to affordable housing stand in contrast to the NYCHA Queensbridge
                        Housing development to the north. Constructed in 1939, it is one of the largest public housing
                        complexes in North America. Along with the adjacent Queensbridge Park, it reflects nearly
                        century-old ideals of living, construction, affordable housing, and landscape which will be
                        reconsidered and re-imagined in this competition. This site has a unique mixed-use zoning
                        designation and an ample allowable FAR. The competition program does not maximize this
                        FAR. Instead, it is to be considered the first of a phased development of this significant site.
                        We were required to anticipate the future phased build-out of this site to utilize the full FAR
                        as
                        a condition of the competition design. All things considered we design an interconnected

                    <div class="project-blurb">After Analyzing the neighborhood of Allston in Boston, MA, we were tasked
                        to design a waterfront
                        development for an urban intervention. This however is tricky due to the controversial history
                        within the site especially, between Harvard and the community of Lower Allston. Currently
                        Harvard Business School is located at the top of Allston with access to the waterfront along
                        the Charles River. Over time, Affordable housing is now being dominated with student tenants
                        and the cost of living is steadily rising in the community. Currently Harvard is proposing to
                        expand
                        their School of Engineering and Applied Science in lower Allston. With this expansion they
                        plan to create he 500,000+ square foot complex will feature state-of-the-art classrooms, active
                        learning labs, maker space, faculty labs, community space and a café.Additionally, Allston
                        Community Task Force and Mass Dot Transit are planning to redesign 1-90 interchange soon.
                        With all these proposals considered we designed a waterfront development to alleviate these
                        tensions while building off future institutional expansion proposals, future transit and
                        mobility
                        design, and existing policies. We proposed a series of art galleries and installations hosted
                        by institutions insi de and out of various neighborhoods in Boston to unite the long term and
                        short-term residents. We incorporated an augmented reality application to supplement the
                        installation experience by using the technology to connect the installations across the city by
                        including it as a walking tour. Our goal is not just to alleviate tensions in Allston but to
                        alleviate
                        to tensions between community members and institutions across Boston due to the similar issues
                        that lie around those areas.</div>

                        Lexington St. in East Boston,
                        MA. The project was the final deliverable for the Design, Development, and Practice Seminar
                        at the MIT Center for Real Estate; the class introduced the concept of the architect as a
                        developer.
                        The project takes a worn-down two-story house and looks at opportunities to convert
                        the house into a new condo development. Bound by zoning restrictions, the adjacent building
                        butting the house’s west elevation, and a real-world budget, our design uses Boston’s
                        quintessential
                        triple-decker archetype to create three spaces for lease. A wood trellis wraps around
                        the building to create a privacy enclosure, restricting views from neighbors while letting in
                        greenery and light.
                        Each space for lease has differing amenities. The first floor is a two-bedroom apartment with a
                        small porch visible from the street. With the lowest amount of privacy, the first-floor condo
                        has
                        the lowest leasing price on the property. The second floor contains a two-story apartment with
                        a large private balcony at the back of the building. The most expensive lease in the building
                        is the third-floor apartment. It is a four-bedroom apartment containing a mezzanine level for
                        entertaining guests and roof access from the street. This upper-level steps back from
                        the roadway to give inhabitants privacy and maintain the consistent building height level from
                        lower views. This increased height limit exceeds zoning regulations, but a zoning variance is

                        experiment
                        to run cost analysis on a design project for an actual client and provided me with the

                    <div class="project-blurb">Working as an intern architect for Goodwyn, Mills, and Cawood, I was
                        fortunate to design a
                        project from scratch. The project is for the owner of DUH! Furniture Store, a popular store for
                        contemporary furniture in Pensacola, FL. The building expands the client’s current showroom,
                        called the barn, on a narrow adjacent lot just outside of the Pensacola Central Business
                        District.
                        The client wanted to build on the bucolic nature of the existing showroom in the new building.
                        Designing the exterior with similar materials—board and batten and siding, and a corrugated
                        metal roof—the design looks to play with the concept of a country porch as an opportunity to
                        showcase outdoor furniture from the street.
                        Functionally, the building still needed to connect to the existing building, which is reinforced
                        in
                        the building’s two gables roofline, designed to match the exaggerated gable roof of the existing
                        building. The extension on the porch typography occurs through the continuation roof over
                        the porch, supported by angled columns and a formal stair. Through this, we set apart the new
                        building from the existing structure while playfully calling patrons, passersby, and collectors
                        to
                        embrace the slow, easygoing nature of the rural lifestyle</div>

                        KONGO CHAIR</div>
                    <div class="project-blurb">This project is a parody of the ubiquitous folding chair. The design
                        method addresses the possibilities,
                        constraints, and challenges of digital fabrication in the design process. After initial
                        sketches, I found that the folding chair could be imagined as two interlocking parts. These
                        interlocking
                        parts can be separated for easy storage or additional functions. Building off African
                        Tribal Chairs and their parody in the Finnish Designers Ilmari Chair, I looked to
                        re-contextualize
                        this design approach in contemporary design computing processes.
                        Through iterative sketching, modeling, and load testing, I developed a design that met the
                        functional requirements of a chair, the constraints of applicable mechanical processes in the
                        laser cutter and the CNC machine, and the design constraint of an interlocking joint. In the
                        digital design process, I made careful attention to the tolerances to resolve the tectonics of
                        design in the assembly process. In the design and prototyping processes, I tested various types
                        of flat wood materials to handle the structural load in the design’s cantilever. And through
                        this
                        material approach, the form of the chair became refined and sophisticated.</div>

                    <div class="project-blurb">In the rural south, accommodations for modern living need to be
                        re-evaluated. With technological advances, the archetypal shotgun house with wood frame
                        construction will not cut it. What formal typologies can improve the housing stock in the rural
                        south? With sustainability in mind, the reuse of shipping containers and wood pallets can create
                        new forms of housing for Athens, Georgia. Current trends in housing in Athens, Georgia, show
                        that there are around 10,000 housing units with many of the houses being five-bedroom units with
                        a value greater than 50,000 and less than 100,000. With cost in mind, the design looks to give
                        consumers in the area the best price possible.
                        The use of shipping containers as the base design allows for various configurations for a flat
                        rate. The use of shipping containers as a building module allows for sustainable communities to
                        develop while achieving cost savings through economies of scale. The design of this modular
                        house combines shipping containers, standard stud construction, wood pallet finishes, and CLT to
                        create a new approach to the modular shipping container home design. The design proposal is an
                        open two-story home with a convertible second level for additional programming.</div>
